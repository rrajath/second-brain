* Tragedy of the Commons
It's a concept where people take advantage of and overuse what's common to everyone assuming that their singular overuse wouldn't affect the whole.

- [[file:question.org][Question]]: Where have I seen this happen?
  + One of the examples I can think of is people littering on the streets? An individual person may think he's not causing much damage and each individual does it. Then it becomes a more serious problem where there's too much litter on the street. This also sounds like [[file:broken_window_theory.org][Broken Window Theory]].
- [[file:question.org][Question]]: Does Tragedy of the Commons apply only to consumption? That is, only when individual /consumes/ from a collective source or does it also apply to each individual's trivial damage to a common resource causing significant damage to that resource making it mostly unusable or at least deteriorated.
- [[file:question.org][Question]]: Have I seen this problem being solved?
