# Introduction <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

Welcome to my Digital Garden. This is like a knowledge base where I store my notes on various topics that I come across and learn. I constantly update it as I learn new things or change my opinion on things.


## How it all started

I was browsing HackerNews recently and came across a post [Ask HN: What keeps you from writing a blog?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24291326)

I could totally relate to this question because to me, blog ideas are supposed to have more quality and thought provoking and useful, and it was a little stressful for me to find a good chunk of time to write a draft, maybe edit it once or twice and then publish. Also, my thoughts on things tend to evolve over time, so my first conception of an idea will take time to shape into something more concrete. One of the comments in that post introduced me to the [concept of a Digital Garden](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24291359) and it hit home with me. I&rsquo;ve been using Notion for exactly that for about 1.5 years and other note taking apps for that exact purpose. I might as well publish my notes as a Digital Garden which would be a living document of my notes, thoughts and learnings on various topics which would constantly evolve.

Thanks to [Nikita&rsquo;s Digital Garden](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) that inspired me to create my own in a similar format.
