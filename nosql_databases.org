* Comparison with RDBMS

| NoSQL                                                                                            | RDBMS                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| insertions and retrievals are easy since all data are together in a JSON blob                    | needs foreign keys and other tables for getting a coherent set of data |
| doesn't guarantee ACID properties, so it can't be used for transactions                          | guarantees ACID                                                        |
| not read optimzed because it has to go to each row, unpack the JSON and update                   | easier because it just has to go to that column and do aggregations    |
| relations are not implicit, which means something like foreign key constraint cannot be enforced | relationships are implicit                                             |
| not built for joins and they are very expensive                                                  | built for joins                                                        |
