* Earth's orbit around the sun

- it's not a circle, not a long ellipse either. But it's a 3% ellipse. So, if the orbit is drawn it's very hard to tell that it's an ellipse and it looks like a circle
- at its closest point (in July), Earth is 91 million miles from the Sun. At its farthest (in Jan), it's 94 million miles
- Summers and Winters have nothing to do with Earth being closed to the Sun or far away from the Sun. The Earth is tilted on an axis (23 degrees). When Sun's rays fall on the side that is tilted towards the Sun, it's summer. The other side experiences winter.
